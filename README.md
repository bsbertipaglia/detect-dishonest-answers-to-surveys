# Detect Dishonest Answers to Surveys using Machine Learning

Lying can be defined as the act of hiding the truth using a false statement with the intention to make someone else believe it. The evaluation of a statement to detect dishonesty is known as lie detection.

The aim is to address the reliability problem and mitigate it by finding a reliable feature selection criterion, i.e. a model that always gives similar importance to features, which, at the same time, gives good performance in lie detection.

Not all feature selection techniques are good in terms of reliability, but among those that are, there is no benchmark method that outperforms all others in every dataset. There are, however, some good candidates who appear to be reliable across all datasets tested.
